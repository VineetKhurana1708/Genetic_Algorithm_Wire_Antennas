Each candidate solution is called a chromosome .
A chromosome constitues a 105 bit vector(called gene from hereon) , a fitness value and a validation bit .
The gene has 5 bits allocated for each value . The order of allocation is x1,y1,z1........x7,y7,z7 (5x3x7=105)  
Validation bit is 1 if the gene represents a valid geometry.
A population consists of 100 chromosomes . (Recommended pop. size = 4n, Goldberg . For our case , 4 x 3 x 7 = 84 ~ 100)




 RULE #1 : No function may be able to edit population data directly . 

Pop_Data;
Return_Value = Func(Pop_Data);
Pop_Data= Return_Value 

and NOT 
Func(Pop_Data)

RULE #2 : For variable and function names , first letter is capital , all others are small . 
If a '.' or '_' appears the next letter is capital as in Rule 1 example .



Most of the below definitions match Udemy course 

Initialisation 
I/p = No of chromosomes , no of bits in chromosome 
O/p = Population Object (Gene=Random, Fitness=0,validation bit=0)

Selection 
I/p = Population
O/p = Selected Chromosomes 

Crossover 
I/p = 2 chromosomes , Pc,mode
o/p= 2 chromosomes

Mutation 
I/p = chromosome , Pm
O/p = 1 chromosome 

Elitism 
I/p = Newpopulation,Population,Er
O/p = Combined Population object

Geometry validation
I/p = 1 Chromosome
O/p = Boolean 

Fitness Function 
I/p = 1 chromosome
O/p = Double

Nec Interface 
I/p = 1 chromosome 
O/p=  Struct of cells
